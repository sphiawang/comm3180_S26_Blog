    "text": "Last semester, I took PSYC001: Introduction to Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania — arguably one of the most relevant courses to my daily life. Over 80+ pages of notes later, I had learned everything from the brain’s role in speech to the effects of sleep deprivation and social isolation. But one unit stayed with me more than the rest: personality.\nSpecifically, how it’s formed.\nI’ve often wondered just how I became the person I am today. Was my “ambiversion” (sudden swings between extroversion and introversion) shaped by my childhood? Would I be more talkative if I had grown up in a different country? A different family? A different name?\nUnfortunately, my professor had no definitive answer. In our final class on personality, she explained that personality is a mix of genetic and environmental factors, and scientists cannot clearly pinpoint which traits come from which source. Some aspects may be inherent, others acquired, but their individual influence cannot be precisely measured.\nNow, in COMM3180, I was given access to a dataset of nearly 20,000 responses from a global Big Five personality survey. With this opportunity, I felt compelled to discover if there is a correlation between certain aspects of an individual and their personality traits.\nIn this blog post, I aim to examine what shapes personality more: internal factors such as age and gender, or external factors such as country and dominant hand. Through this analysis, I hope to better understand whether nature or nurture plays a more visible role."

    "text": "Are Young People More Extroverted?\nIn PSYC001, I learned that certain Big Five traits show average changes across age groups. To test this, I first examined whether there was a relationship between age and extroversion (a trait that was commonly used as an example in the class). Using the survey responses, I grouped participants into age ranges (from the 10s through the 70s) and calculated the average extroversion score for each group, and visualized the results in a bar chart.\nWhat I found surprised me.\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nbig5_df = pd.read_csv('data/openpsych_data.csv', sep='\\t')\n\n\nnegative_items = ['E2', 'E4', 'E6', 'E8', 'E10', 'N2', 'N4', 'A1', 'A3', 'A5', 'A7', 'C2', 'C4', 'C6', 'C8', 'O2', 'O4', 'O6']\n\n\nfor item in negative_items:\n    big5_df[item] = 6 - big5_df[item]\n\n\nE_items = ['E1', 'E2', 'E3', 'E4', 'E5', 'E6', 'E7', 'E8', 'E9', 'E10']\nN_items = ['N1', 'N2', 'N3', 'N4', 'N5', 'N6', 'N7', 'N8', 'N9', 'N10']\nA_items = ['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5', 'A6', 'A7', 'A8', 'A9', 'A10']\nC_items = ['C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5', 'C6', 'C7', 'C8', 'C9', 'C10']\nO_items = ['O1', 'O2', 'O3', 'O4', 'O5', 'O6', 'O7', 'O8', 'O9', 'O10']\n\n\nbig5_df['Extroversion'] = big5_df[E_items].sum(axis=1)\nbig5_df['Neuroticism'] = big5_df[N_items].sum(axis=1)\nbig5_df['Agreeableness'] = big5_df[A_items].sum(axis=1)\nbig5_df['Conscientiousness'] = big5_df[C_items].sum(axis=1)\nbig5_df['Openness'] = big5_df[O_items].sum(axis=1)\n\n\ntraits = ['Extroversion','Neuroticism','Agreeableness','Conscientiousness','Openness']\n\n\nbig5_df['age_group'] = pd.cut(big5_df['age'], bins=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80], labels=['10s', '20s', '30s', '40s', '50s', '60s', '70s'])\n\n\nages_extroversion = big5_df.groupby('age_group')['Extroversion'].mean()\n\n\nages_extroversion.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title(\"Average Extroversion by Age Group\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Extroversion Score\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy assumption that extraversion steadily decreases with age was only partially correct. In this sample of 20,000 people, extroversion actually increased slightly from the younger age groups into midlife. Individuals in their 10s and 30s scored around 27–31, while those in their 40s and 50s averaged closer to 35. It wasn’t until the 60s and 70s that extroversion declined back to levels similar to the youngest groups.\nWhile extroversion does decrease later in life, I didn’t expect it to rise into midlife first. Perhaps individuals in their 40s and 50s experience greater emotional or financial stability, making them more socially confident. The later decline could relate to health changes or lifestyle shifts. Although the data alone cannot explain the reasons, it made me curious whether other traits would reveal clearer patterns."

My parents, on the other hand, seem significantly less reactive to daily pressures (perhaps because my siblings and I are out of the house).

This is reassuring for someone currently in the youngest age group. Interestingly, neuroticism increases again in the 70s. This could reflect health challenges or other stressors associated with aging. While I cannot determine causation, the pattern suggests that emotional reactivity evolves across the lifespan."

However, openness and agreeableness ever so slightly stood out. Ambidextrous individuals scored slightly higher in openness (around 39) compared to left or right handed individuals (around 37). Moreover, right handed individuals had slightly higher conscientiousness levels.\nWhile this observation is small and quite insignificant, I can’t help but wonder if ambidextrous individuals may already demonstrate flexibility or experimentation in developing both hands, which could reflect broader openness to experiences. Additionally, since majority of people are right handed, this could explain lower levels of agreeableness because there’s a larger pool. While speculative, this finding could be a more interesting biological pattern in the data."

However, the data alone cannot fully explain them. Still, the relatively small gaps suggest that gender does not overwhelmingly dictate all aspects personality. Through this, I wanted to see personality influences on a broader more external scale."

In contrast, countries like Malaysia and the Philippines showed lower variation, meaning individuals’ scores were more clustered.\nWhile the average levels were similar, the spread differed. This suggests that culture may not drastically change the overall level of a trait but may influence how similar individuals within a society are to one another."

    "text": "Conclusion: What Shapes Us Most?\nAcross nearly 20,000 individuals, my data suggests that personality is influenced more by life stage than by fixed demographic categories. Age showed the most consistent and visible patterns, particularly in traits like extraversion and neuroticism, which shifted gradually across decades.\nGender differences were present, but the gaps between averages were relatively small compared to the variation within each group. This suggests that while gender may correlate with certain traits, it does not strongly determine personality outcomes. Similarly, biological characteristics such as dominant hand showed only minor differences, indicating that innate physical traits do not meaningfully predict overall personality.\nLocation and cultural background revealed variation in distributions rather than dramatic shifts in average scores. In other words, people across countries were more similar than different, but the spread of traits within countries differed. This implies that social environments may shape how personality traits are expressed rather than fundamentally altering the traits themselves.\nAltogether, my findings support a combined interpretation: personality appears to be shaped gradually through developmental processes and social context rather than determined by any single demographic factor. Age emerges as the most influential variable in this dataset, suggesting that personality evolves alongside life experience."

    "text": "This summer of 2026, Philadelphia will host the FIFA World Cup! Whether you’re a Philadelphia native or someone across the globe, one important question remains: what kind of weather should fans expect?\nPhiladelphia summers are known for their heat and intense humidity, but how intense is that heat really? To answer this question, I analyzed 20 years of historical weather data (2005–2025) for Philadelphia, focusing specifically on the World Cup window: June 11 through July 19. While my analysis cannot predict the exact weather you can expect this summer, it can provide a strong sense of what you are most likely to experience based on long-term trends!\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nweather_df = pd.read_csv('data/philadelphia_weather_2005_to_2025.csv')\nweather_df = weather_df.assign(date=pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']))\nThe first step in my analysis was to see how often there are hot days during the World Cup timeline (June 11 - July 19)? Using a threshold of 85°F, I calculated the percentage of days in each year during the World Cup window that exceeded this temperature.\nThe results show a clear pattern. In most years, between 60% and 75% of days during this period reached at least 85°F. Several years exceeded 80%, meaning that nearly every day during the window was hot. Only one year (2009) stands out as a significantly cooler outlier.\nworldcup_df = weather_df[((weather_df[\"month_num\"] == 6) & (weather_df[\"day_num\"] &gt;= 11)) |((weather_df[\"month_num\"] == 7) & (weather_df[\"day_num\"] &lt;= 19))]\n\nworldcup_df = worldcup_df[(worldcup_df[\"year\"] &gt;= 2005) & (worldcup_df[\"year\"] &lt;= 2025)]\nworldcup_df[\"hot_day\"] = worldcup_df[\"high\"] &gt;= 85\nhot_days_per_year = worldcup_df.groupby(\"year\")[\"hot_day\"].mean() * 100\noverall_hot_day_percent = hot_days_per_year.mean()\nplt.plot(hot_days_per_year.index, hot_days_per_year.values, marker='o', linewidth=2)\n\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Percent (%)')\nplt.title('Percent of Hot Days (≥ 85°F)')\n\nplt.show()\nThis chart clearly illustrates that most days during the World Cup timeline will be hot! Fans attending matches should expect hot conditions on most days, not just during occasional heat waves. Thus, panning for sustained heat, rather than brief exposure, will be key –&gt; definitely remember to bring water and sunscreen!"
